Description:

When you are new to a place, have you ever found it difficult making a decision about where to eat? How is the food like there? How is the environment? Doing research takes time, and having to make a choice in the end makes it even worse. Well, don’t worry, Picker is here to save you from all of these.

Picker is easy and fun - swiping up to like the food/view, and swiping down to pass. After a few swipes, we will recommend top 3 restaurants based on your choices. At the very beginning, you can choose different commuting ways, i.e., walk, bus or taxi. Set the maximum time you want to spend on commuting to the restaurants, and you are good to go! Picker will provide a series of pictures from restaurants in range for you. When you finish swiping, recommended restaurants will be presented with details in a list as well as a map.

Making decisions about a restaurant is difficult, while deciding you like a picture or not is easy. Our app helps you find an ideal restaurant effortlessly, which is not done in any other apps.

Let’s get started now. Find a perfect place to eat for your family, friends, or important dates in just 3 minutes!
